# machine_learning_notebook

This project is a group project that we created as part of our machine learning course at emlyon.\
The aim of this project is to determine who is more likely to buy an electric car as their next or first car ?\
To do so we created a survey and collected the data and analysed it. we then benchmarked machine learning algorithms and picked the best one based on their accuracy to the study and the data.\
\
data is available in the csv file.\ 
The notebook has all the analysis and code that helped us get to the results.\
The pdf file has the presentation of the case along with the results. \
